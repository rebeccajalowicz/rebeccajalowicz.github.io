            <br>
            While a lot of my work was done using Wordpress, my first
            introduction into web development was learning html and css. I
            figured the best way to show my knowledge in this area was to build
            my own website.
            <br>
            <br>
            Planning: I planned everything on google slides because it
            is very easy to manage and easy to visualize and conceptualize
            through that particular format. You can see the google slides by
            clicking <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1irKwOhufsBZhWza_Q74kQIFWtxAIqmRtGO8MgbW77UQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this link!</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Steps:
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Inspiration
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ What Pages to Include
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Page Content and Layout
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Color Scheme
            <br>
            <br>
            Development:
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Atom used as code editor
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ HTML and css
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Bootsrap used for the collapsables on this page
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Hosted on Github Pages --you can see all of my code in my <a href="https://github.com/rebeccajalowicz" target="_blank" >github repository!</a>

            <br>
            <br>
            This site was based off an article found in Trentonia (history
            collection found in the Trenton Public Library) explaining the Hall
            Mills Murder case. It's purpose is to inform the user of the contents
            of the article in an interesting and engaging format. Users go through
            evidence and "solve" one of the longest unsolved murder mysteries.
            <br>
            <br>
            This was a group project for the class IMM 280 Design Perspectives. My
            group and I worked with Trentoniana as a client to make this website
            for visitors to use to educate themselves about the Hall Mills Case. We
            worked with the directors in order to give them a website that works
            best for their typical visitors while still being an entertaining form
            of learning. Our project can also be viewed on the Trentoniana website
            found <a href="https://www.trentonlib.org/student-projects" target="_blank" >here.</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            My Role: Wordpress Developer
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ My group split responsibilities in 4 ways:
            writing, video editing, graphics and the developing of the website
            itself (my role).
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Essentially I was given all of the content needed
            for the site and put it all together cohesively. Specifically I chose
            the theme, plugins and overall development of all of the pages on the site
            along with planning how the "game" aspect of the project was going to
            work.
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ For the home and explore page, all that was necessary
            was to put in all the information required of those pages as those were
            static, imformative pages.
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ The game page consists of several pages on the site
            to give the illusion of flipping through a report file.
            <br> &nbsp&nbsp ~ Within the pages of the game, I used a plugin for
            pop ups so that the user can click on pictures and evidence without exiting
            the game itself. On the very last page of the game I used a plug in to create
            a poll so users can vote on who they think commited the crime. This is how
            users "solve" the unsolved mystery.

              <br>
              <br>
              This site was based off an magazine publication titled "The 250TH
              Anniversary of the Settlement of Trenton," found in Trentonia (history
              collection found in the Trenton Public Library). It's purpose is to act
              as the voice of the publication as if it were able to speak. The project
              in question was to find an artifact in Trentoniana and create a project
              in which to portray if the object could speak, what would it say?
              <br>
              <br>
              This was a solo project for the class IMM 280 Design Perspectives.I worked
              with Trentoniana as a client to make this website for visitors
              to use to educate themselves about the anniversary of the settlement of
              Trenton.
              <br>
              <br>
              My interpretation of this assignment was to create a blog where the magazine
              would "speak," so to say. The magazine had blog posts about different topics
              about Trenton both from the past and now. I chose to host this website on wordpress
              because wordpress already has a good template for blogs.
              <br>
              <br>
              My Role: Since this was a solo project, I did everything this website is
              composed of. I chose a blank theme, did my own layout and made all of the
              graphics featured throughout. I used mostly pictures of the publication itself
              throughout the website. However, I decided to make graphics for the
              blog page itself because it made the page more playful as a whole. Since
              the blogs are from a pretend narrator, having a cartoon version of the magazine
              added to whole "if it could talk" theme of the project.

                <br>
                For my Fall 2019 Semster in college I was the Webmaster for Alpha
                Phi Omega (co-ed community service fraternity) on the executive board.
                Unfortunately the server the database our old website that we had previously used
                was deleted just before I was elected. The entirety of my semester was spent
                developing a new site for APO to use.
                <br>
                <br>
                My Role: I developed the wordpress aspect of this site. There is a calendar
                portion to this website utilized by the brotherhood that was made by someone else.
                Since that semester I have moved on to another role within the brotherhood
                therefore the new webmaster has been updating the website as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                Specifically I was in charge of the initial creation of the website. I bought the domain,
                and pointed it to the wordpress site and calendar. Along with this I designed the basic theme
                and layout of the website. This includes the color scheme and the general layout. Since that semester
                there have been updates to the website but I contributed significantly to the
                creation and early development of this site along with the look and feel of the
                site as a whole.

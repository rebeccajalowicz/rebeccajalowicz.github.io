        While a lot of my work was done using Wordpress, my first
        introduction into web development was learning html and css. I
        figured the best way to show my knowledge in this area was to build
        my own website.
        <br>
        <br>
        Planning: I planned everything on adobe xd, you can see more of that process on the adobe page!
        <br>
        <br>
        Development:
        <ui>
          <li>Atom used as code editor</li>
          <li>HTML and CSS</li>
          <li>Hosted on Github Pages --you can see all of my code in my <a href="https://github.com/rebeccajalowicz"
            target="_blank" >github repository!</a></li>

      <a href="http://hallmills.immtcnj.com/" target="_blank" >Hall Mills Murder Mystery</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      This site was based off an article found in Trentonia (history
      collection found in the Trenton Public Library) explaining the Hall
      Mills Murder case. It's purpose is to inform the user of the contents
      of the article in an interesting and engaging format. Users go through
      evidence and "solve" one of the longest unsolved murder mysteries.
      <br>
      <br>
      This was a group project for the class IMM 280 Design Perspectives. My
      group and I worked with Trentoniana as a client to make this website
      for visitors to use to educate themselves about the Hall Mills Case. We
      worked with the directors in order to give them a website that works
      best for their typical visitors while still being an entertaining form
      of learning. Our project can also be viewed on the Trentoniana website
      found <a href="https://www.trentonlib.org/student-projects" target="_blank" >here.</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      My Role: Wordpress Developer
      <ui>
        <li>My group split responsibilities in 4 ways:
        writing, video editing, graphics and the developing of the website
        itself (my role).</li>
        <li>Essentially I was given all of the content needed
        for the site and put it all together cohesively. Specifically I chose
        the theme, plugins and overall development of all of the pages on the site
        along with planning how the "game" aspect of the project was going to
        work.</li>
        <li>For the home and explore page, all that was necessary
        was to put in all the information required of those pages as those were
        static, imformative pages.</li>
        <li>The game page consists of several pages on the site
        to give the illusion of flipping through a report file.</li>
        <li>Within the pages of the game, I used a plugin for
        pop ups so that the user can click on pictures and evidence without exiting
        the game itself. On the very last page of the game I used a plug in to create
        a poll so users can vote on who they think commited the crime. This is how
        users "solve" the unsolved mystery.</li>

      <a href="https://250trentonsettlement.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" >250th Anniversary of the Settlement of Trenton</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      This site was based off an magazine publication titled "The 250TH
      Anniversary of the Settlement of Trenton," found in Trentonia (history
      collection found in the Trenton Public Library). It's purpose is to act
      as the voice of the publication as if it were able to speak. The project
      in question was to find an artifact in Trentoniana and create a project
      in which to portray if the object could speak, what would it say?
      <br>
      <br>
      This was a solo project for the class IMM 280 Design Perspectives.I worked
      with Trentoniana as a client to make this website for visitors
      to use to educate themselves about the anniversary of the settlement of
      Trenton.
      <br>
      <br>
      My interpretation of this assignment was to create a blog where the magazine
      would "speak," so to say. The magazine had blog posts about different topics
      about Trenton both from the past and now. I chose to host this website on wordpress
      because wordpress already has a good template for blogs.
      <br>
      <br>
      My Role: Since this was a solo project, I did everything this website is
      composed of. I chose a blank theme, did my own layout and made all of the
      graphics featured throughout. I used mostly pictures of the publication itself
      throughout the website. However, I decided to make graphics for the
      blog page itself because it made the page more playful as a whole. Since
      the blogs are from a pretend narrator, having a cartoon version of the magazine
      added to whole "if it could talk" theme of the project.

      <br>
      For my Fall 2019 Semster in college I was the Webmaster for Alpha
      Phi Omega (co-ed community service fraternity) on the executive board.
      Unfortunately the server the database our old website that we had previously used
      was deleted just before I was elected. The entirety of my semester was spent
      developing a new site for APO to use.
      <br>
      <br>
      My Role: I developed the wordpress aspect of this site. There is a calendar
      portion to this website utilized by the brotherhood that was made by someone else.
      Since that semester I have moved on to another role within the brotherhood
      therefore the new webmaster has been updating the website as well.
      <br>
      <br>
      Specifically I was in charge of the initial creation of the website. I bought the domain,
      and pointed it to the wordpress site and calendar. Along with this I designed the basic theme
      and layout of the website. This includes the color scheme and the general layout. Since that semester
      there have been updates to the website but I contributed significantly to the
      creation and early development of this site along with the look and feel of the
      site as a whole.

      <h4>Part I: Simple Immediate Fixes</h4>
    </div>
    <p>I started by doing simple mockups of the faculty-led pages in the site and
      the study abroad pages as well. I made simple mockups in order to see some
      of the big differences between each page. </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "casestudy">
    <h5>Faculty-Led Pages</h5>
    <br>
    <p>The two most notable obvious differences between all of the pages is the
      grid at the bottom of the page and how some pages have square featured images
      while others have circles. The easiest solution in this case is just to add
      the grids to the bottom of all the pages and either have all of the pictures
      be circles or all of the pictures be squares. In this case all of the major
      shapes in each page would be the same which would help to make each page more
      uniform. Most pages already have this format but for reference the “Italy:
      Rome of the Caesars, Rome Of the Popes” is a good page to reference for a
      general theme.</p>

        <p>If videos are needed, add to the bottom of the course description, ideally
          they would be embedded so someone could watch them directly on the page
          instead of being redirected somewhere else.</p>

      <h4>Final Summary</h4>
    </div>
    <div class - "left">
      <p>Overall, the site's inconsistencies stem from mismatched layouts and
        varying information from page to page. The easiest way to address this is
        to make smaller changes to each page as an immediate fix. For example making
        sure all of the subtitles match on each page and for something like the
        faculty led pages, having all images be in the shape of a circle. For the
        Study Abroad programs, there should be more subtitles added to make it
        easier to skim if parents, students or faculty need to find information
        relatively quickly. As more of a long term goal the formatting should
        be edited to fit the layout of the homepage. We don’t have access to
        change the homepage so in order to make a more consistent site, we can
        change the other pages to match the homepage. This can be done by changing
        the color scheme and fonts along with having the layout be more center-aligned
        and broken down into color blocks. </p>

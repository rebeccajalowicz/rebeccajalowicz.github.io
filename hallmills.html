      This was a project done for the class IMM 280: Design Perspectives in collaboration
      with Trentoniana. Trentoniana is a branch of the Trenton Public Library which houses
      artifacts from historical Trenton and other areas in New Jersey.

          for the mood and tone was the Buzzfeed Unsolved video series from
          Buzzfeed.

            <h5>First Iteration:</h5>
            <p>This image is a rough sketch of how we wanted the website to work at
            the time. It was initially going to be one long page with pop-ups
            embedded throughout it.</p>
            <p><h5>User Testing: </h5>We had the workers at Trentoniana test the
              first design with a basic layout on the WordPress site. </p>

        <p><h5>Second Iteration:</h5> Wireframes</p>
        <p>We changed the functionality of the game by making it multiple pages

          The user can click back and forth between pages. </p>

          <h5>Why the redesign: </h5>
          <ul>
            <li>User feedback: The people from Trentoniana suggested having
              multiple pages as opposed to one static page to interact with, the
              team agreed with them. </li>
            <li>Overall having multiple pages would create a more active experience
              as there are more options for the user to interact with the case file
              itself. Along with this, it would also lessen the short-term memory
              load on the user as there will be a little information on several pages
               as opposed to a lot of information. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "casestudy">
      <p><h5>New Problem: </h5>How do we simulate that the user is flipping through
        pages in the case file?</p>
      <p><h5>Solution: </h5>Have different colored tabs, start with them all on
        one side of the case file, have them switch to the other side when moving
        to the next page to simulate that some pages have passed and there are more
        pages to go.</p>

            <li><h5>Why the redesign: </h5> User feedback, we agreed with our professor to
              change the navigation links both in content and location. It is easier
              for the user as there is less to read while still accomplishing the
              same task as before, we simplified the step. </li>

        <h4>Solution:</h4>
      </div>
      <p><h5>The Pitch:</h5> What if you could solve one of the oldest unsolved crimes in history?</p>
      <p>The Hall-Mills murder is one of the nation's oldest unsolved crimes,
        taking place in New Jersey in 1922. In this web-application based game
        users will be able to click through an interactive case file to look through
        clues, hear testimonials from witnesses, and finally to "vote" on who they
        think committed the crime.</p>

        <h5>Symbols Page</h5>
        <p>On this page the user clicks on each symbol in order to learn the

          <h5>Looking Back: What I Would Change</h5>
          <p>Overall I would advocate for more user testing throughout the only
            people we had tested out the project were the clients and the professor.
            While it was important to please both the professor and the client,
            they aren't the target audience for the game.</p>
            <h5>What I Would Suggest To My Past Self:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Before designing - make sure the content is okay for kids, find a
                good age range, and see if it is a topic they find interesting.</li>
              <li>During Development - have several kids test out the game and see
                if they know how to navigate and iterate the design based on what
                they said, have other college students test it out to see if it is
                a project they find interesting.</li>
              <li>Final Testing - have several kids test out the game and see if they
                know how to navigate and iterate the design based on what they said,
                have other college students test it out to see if it is a project they
                would find interesting.</li>
            </ul>
          <h5>What I Learned</h5>
          <p>This project was my first introduction to UX and the design process,
            I learned a lot about collaboration and iterating ideas based on user
            feedback. This is the project where I decided to pursue UI/UX so I am
            very grateful for it. </p>

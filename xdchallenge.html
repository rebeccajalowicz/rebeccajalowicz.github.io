    <div class = "left">
      <p>This piece is a simple landing page for the flower shop Jolly Florals. The goal for the look and feel for this piece is modern and elegant.</p>
      <p>Skills Learned:
        <ul>
          <li>Making a component to be used again - Made the green explore button a component and used it again with the button labeled "Buy"</li>
          <li>Background Blur - Used in the Footer</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class = "left">
        <p>Here I made a dark mode version of a store or restaurant locator app, similar to yelp.</p>
        <p>Skills Learned:
          <ul>
            <li>Scroll Groups - A scroll group was used to make the map itself movable along
              with being able to scroll through the different restaurants on the bottom of the screen</li>
            <li>Repeat Grids - Used in bottom of the screen to make multiple restaurants</li>

      <div class = "left">
        <p>This piece is a notification center for people working in an office. With
          this notification center, users would be able to see who in their company is working at that moment and what specifically they are working on. </p>
        <p>Skills Learned:
          <ul>
            <li>Hover States - The default state is an empty screen and hover state is the notification center sliding into the screen. </li>
            <li>Auto Animate vs. Transition - Transition is used to make the hover effect over the coworkers because auto animate took longer to display the effect.</li>

    <div class = "left">
      <p>This piece is a concept for what an augrmented reality experience for a workplace could be.
        The person using this is someone going to an interview, the AR shows him exaclty where he needs to go, along with who else is in the office.</p>
      <p>Skills Learned:
        <ul>
          <li>3d Transforms - Used to make the triangles at the bottom appear to be leading away from the screen along with the worker id's to be angled in front of their desks.</li>

        <p>Here is just a template for a possible presentation. Instead of using something like google slides or powerpoint, I would potentially be able to use Xd as well.</p>
        <p>Skills Learned:
          <ul>
            <li>Trigger using keys and gamepad - Used right arrow key to transition between slides in protyping mode.</li>

        <p>Here is a sample landing page for a music library. I tried to make an app in dark mode again, this time it was more
          so because I think it worked well with the mood of the page. </p>
        <p>Skills Learned:
          <ul>
            <li>Similarly to the slide out menu this piece is more of a combination of skills previously
              learned. Although I feel like with this piece I focused more on layout so I developed more of an understanding in that area.</li>

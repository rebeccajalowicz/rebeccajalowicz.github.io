    <h1>Revival</h1>
    <p>Revival is a concept of a game developed in a 24 hour hackathon taking place at The College of
      New Jersey. It is an open world game in which the user wakes up in a house and needs to complete
      tasks in order to make a mask and go outside into a polluted world. From there on is it an open
      world game where the player needs to work to clean up the world from the pollution which is poisoning it.

      Part of what made this hackathon so successful was because of our team.
      We worked really well together and even though it was a virtual Hackathon we
      were able to communicate freely and encouraged each other while doing so.

        <h5>The Problem:</h5>
        <p>Create a game that simulates a form of quarantine and relies on familiar
          feelings from living through the covid-19 pandemic, but acts as an escape
          from the anxieties that comes from the pandemic.

        <div class = "left"
        <p>Our group was both inspired by how the pandemic affects people's mental
           health but also how games relate to that as a type of coping mechanism.
           These ideas came from a group discussion from our own personal
           experiences and were validated through research on the topics. Here
           are two of the articles we found that validated our ideas and led us
           to create Revival.

        <h5>First Iteration: </h5>
        <p>I started the design process by making a quick graphic in illustrator
          of what the world would look like ideally. It was a simple map just to
          give the team an idea of what we wanted and how to proceed with developing
          the game. From here we decided that with the time constraints, it was best
          to focus on the house  and a small portion of the outside world.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "casestudy">
      <div class = "center">
        <h5>Paper Prototyping</h5>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>After this I began making paper prototypes for how the game would look.
        Initially we were planning having the house be a square and the outside be
        square as well. In order to make the game in unity, there would have to be
        separate images for the background and furniture in order to make the
        furniture colliders so the main character could not walk over an object
        like a bed or a table.</p>
        <img src = "revival/rapidsketch_inside.jpeg" alt = "" class = "half" width = "100%">

    <div class = "casestudy">
      <img src = "revival/timmy.png" alt = "" width = "35%" class = "centerimg">
      <div class = "casestudy">
        <p>While my role was to make the background whereas another team member
          made the furniture, add smaller details and design the main character,
          lovingly named Timmy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "casestudy">
      <div class = "half">
      <div class = "left">
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>Initial Background: </h5>
        <p>In order to make the game in unity, there would have to be separate images for the background
          and furniture in order to make the furniture colliders so the main
          character could not walk over an object like a bed or a table. I made
          the background whereas another team member made the furniture and
          the main character.</p>
          <div class = "smallgray">
          <p><h5>New Problem: </h5>Unity had a set ratio for the size of the background
            and what the user could see at a given time. The ratio was a recatngle as opposed to a square.
            If the current background were to be used, it would bee too zoomed in and the user would not be
            able to see enough of the background to know where to go.</p>
          <p><h5>Solution: </h5>Reformat the background</p>
          </div>

        <h5>Second Iteration: </h5>
      </div>
      <div class = "left">
        <p>Here is what the redesigns looked like, again due to time constraints
          it was best for me to just reformat what I had already created as opposed
          to sketch something entirely new.</p>
          <img src = "revival/houseback.png" alt = "" width = "100%">
          <div class = "smallspace"></div>
          <p>Once the player gets outside of their house the world is polluted and the
             player has to clean up the world. For this I needed to make 2 backgrounds,
             a polluted world and a clean world</p>

      <p><h5>The pitch:</h5> After waking up from a horrifying nightmare that is
        their harsh reality, the player must escape their house in order to cleanse
        the world from pollution. Before doing so, they must build a mask to protect
        themselves from the polluted air and to freely traverse the open world,
        starting off with their own neighborhood. From picking up garbage to taking
         out forest fires, the player must do whatever it is possible to reduce
         pollution so they can save their beloved planet from the harmful and
         poisonous takeover.</p>

          <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
          <p>This was a 24 hour event and while I am very proud of the outcome and
            all of the hard work my team and I put into this there are still some
            things I would love to see if the project ever gets continued. </p>
          <p>What to continue in terms of game development:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fully fleshed out world</li>
            <li>Make games for all of the tasks needed to move on within the world itself</li>
            <li>Make the game multiplayer, be able to save the world with your friends!</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Along with this the UX designer of the team, while we were able to
            map user journeys and the entire project was based around a user’s mental
            health in the time of a pandemic, I wish i was able to validate some of the
            ideas we came up with. There was just simply not enough time to reach out
            to people in order to test our ideas and game and we were not able to go
            out into the field to test either as we are still very restricted during
            the pandemic. However if we had the time and we were able to do user
            testing here is what I would have liked to do:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h5>Pre-Development: </h5>Survey people what games they like the
                most right now, if it helps them cope, what they need to feel comforted/wind
                down these days, is climate change/pollution too real of a topic for
                escapism? Would that make you more depressed?</li>
              <li><h5>During Development: </h5>Run a cognitive walkthrough, make
                sure the user knows when a task needs to happen and validate if
                they are able to complete the task.</li>
              <li><h5>Post-Development: </h5> Have the users play the game and
                interview them afterwards. Some examples of questions might be:
                Is this too triggering/too real? (the purpose is to bring joy
                not frustration), Is the game fun? Would you play with your friends?
                Do you feel a sense of escapism when you play? What other changes
                would you recommend?</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Then I would simply ideate and iterate based off of all of the research
              found at each step in order to make this game the best it could possibly be.</p>

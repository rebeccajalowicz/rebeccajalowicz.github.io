      <h5>Overview: </h5>
      This was a project done for the class CSC 355: Human Computer Interaction at
      The College of New Jersey. The class itself focused on accessibility and universal design.

        <h4>The Problem:</h4>
        <p>How can we make games and web applications more accessible to everyone?
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "grayback">
      <div class = "casestudy">
        <h4>Preliminary Research</h4>
        <p class = "left">We decided to research different versions of well known games, specifically
          tic tac toe. We were able to find a physical version of tic tac toe for people with visual impairments
          but nothing comprehensive for an online or digital version.
          <a href = "http://www.braillebookstore.com/Tic--Tac--Toe,-Plastic.1" target="_blank" class = "underline">Here is the link to the physical version we found</a> </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "left">After discovering this we decided on making an version of tic tac toe for those with visual impairments that can be played on a computer.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class = "casestudy">
      <div class = "center">
        <h4>Design Process:</h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "left">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><h5>First Iteration: </h5>We decided we wanted multiple ways to play the game to allow the user to choose which mode works best for them. The three modes we decided were
        using the mouse, they keyboard and voice activation.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class = "smallgray">
          <p><h5>Storyboarding: </h5>From there I created storyboards, using google slides, to show how each mode would work and any
            messages that would pop up.</p>
          <img src = "tictactoe/storyboarding.png" width = "100%" alt = "">
        </div>
        <div class = "smallspace"></div>
          <p>Due to time constraints we had to start developping the game as soon as possible so we added and made changes to the game itself
            instead of making mockups for user testing. At this point we had the following features implemented:
          <ul>
            <li>Mouse Controls</li>
            <li>Keyboard Controls (number on keyboard corresponding to box on screen)</li>
            <li>Voice Recognition (number corresponding to box on screen said out loud after pressing voice recognition button)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class = "onethird">

      <h5>First Iteration User Testing</h5>
      <p>I created a survey to get feedback on what we had so far after our first iteration of accessible tic tac toe.
        The goal for this round of user testing was to get feedback on what he had,
        catch any errors early on and to get suggestions from users on what to include
        and do next. In total we had 18 people fill out the survey anonymously. You can see the
        survey and the questions asked <a href ="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvjYglOWr_jZosmt-Oof9ERdL6lX0o8MRZCV9-a7ZarACIZA/viewform" target="_blank" class = "underline">here</a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I created a user journey map in order to analyze and show visually the feedback from the survey:
      </p>
      <img src = "tictactoe/userjourneyr1.png" width = "80%" class = "centerimg" alt = "">
      <br>
      <div class = "smallgray">
        <p>We also got feedback from someone who is visually impared, here are the suggestions she gave us:
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure to have a high contrast in colors, black background with white text</li>
            <li>The game would be better overall if the text was larger</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "casestudy">
      <p><h5>Second Iteration: </h5>We decided to listen to the feedback from the
        visually impaired user as the game is designed with those with visual impairments in mind. We also got a lot of feedbacl about frustration with
      voice control and not knowing the keyboard was available to use. Here are the issues given in the feedback and the solutions we made based off of them:

        <p><h5>Simple Mockups: </h5> Prior to implementing the color scheme changes ong the web application itself,
        I made some basic mockups of what we wanted to include. </p>

    <div class = "casestudy">
      <p>From here we implemented the color changing feautres along with changing the text size. Since other group members were working on
        recognition and adding a "read the board" feature, I was the one to implement this part of the project. I made all of the different css files
        along with a little bit of javascript to switch the files after clicking a button.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Here is what the different color schemes looked like:</p>

      <div class = "half">
      <p>We also included a feature to increase the text size, at this point we ran
        into an issue where the text would go behind the buttons when increased. This wou;d be fixed in the next iteration</p>
        <p>Here is what the site looked like when the text was increased</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "casestudy">
      <p>We also implemented a "read the board feature where a syntehtic voice
        would read the board from right to left stating where the x's and o's were"

        <h5>User Feedback From Professor</h5>
        <p>Our group had a checkin with our professor on our progress. We had her test out the game and she gave us the following advice:
          <ul>
            <li>Work one the layout, it is slightly off centered</li>
            <li>The read the board feature is a bit confusing, try to play around with other ways to read the board (ex. only read where the x's are or only read where the o's are)</li>
            <li>The speed at which the syntehtic voice read the board was too fast</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "casestudy">
      <p><h5>Third Iteration:</h5>We decided to go through a third and final iteration of design due to feedback
        from the professor and other technical issues we ran into during the second iteration (namely the text
        going behind buttons when the size was increased)</p>
      <p>Here are the changes we made based off the feedbacl we recieved:</p>

      <h5>Third Iteration User Testing</h5>
      <p>I created a survey to get feedback on the third iteration of accessible tic tac toe.
        The overall goal from this survey was to see if the changes made to the game improved
        the overall experience since the prior round of user testing. It was also used to see if our goals
        for the project overall were met and if we succeeded in making an accessible game. In total we had
        25 people fill out the survey anonymously. You can see the survey and the questions

        <li>Responses for the layout and functionality of the game itself went up</li>
        <li>Main issue people brought up was the voice recognition and the synthetic
        voice narrating each move.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br> ***Multiple people tested the game on mobile devices, which are incompatible with the Voice Recognition

        <ul>
          <li>Instructions explain each way user can interact with the site to play the game along with how to use the voice recognition</li>
          <li>Gives one example on how to use the game instead of being very repetitive like in the 2nd iteration of the game</li>

        <h5>Read the Board</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Reads each cell (1-9)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If cell is empty, it reads out the cell number</li>
            <li>If cell is taken, it reads out either x or o depending on what is in the cell</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Three other options for how to read the board: reads where the empty cells are, the x cells and the o cells</li>
          <li>Also buttons to speed up or slow down the synthetic voice</li>

          <h5>Future Considerations</h5>
          <p>I think the project could use one more design iteration, it is nearly
            there but there are a few things I still would like to work on before I think the project can be considered fully finished.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h5>Read the board: </h5>A couple of people wrote that this feature in
                particular was frustrating, this was added in between the first user
                testing and the final user testing. Had we tested this feature a bit
                more I think my group and I would have been able to come up with
                a more successful solution.</li>
              <li><h5>Change the Color Scheme: </h5>The is a split second between
                switching color schemes that the web application displays the page
                without any css and there is a quick flash of white. It's a bit
                jarring and takes away from the feature itself.</li>
            </ul>

          <h5>What I learned:</h5>
          <p>This project was my first introduction into universal design and accessible
            technology. I particularly found it very interesting seeing how different colors affect
            people with visual impairments. I also foudn it interesting to combine new technology,
            such as voice control, with games people are already familar with in order to make them more accessible. </p>
